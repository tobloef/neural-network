# Neural Network from scratch
This is a Python 3 implementation of a neural network, written without the use of any machine learning libraries. Only Numpy and Micheal Nielsen's mnist_loader is used. I use the classic MNIST character recognition example to train and test the network.

To run the network you will need to install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), then you can run the main.py file from this repository.
